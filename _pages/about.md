I‚Äôm Jisheng Bai, a Ph.D. student at the Joint Laboratory of Environmental Sound Sensing, School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China. My supervisor at NWPU is Prof. Jianfeng Chen. My research includes topics related to audio signal processing in Industry, Smart City, and Domestic. I am now a visiting Ph.D. student at the Digital Signal Processing Lab/Smart Nation Translational Lab, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My supervisor at NTU is Prof. Woon-Seng Gan.
