I received the Ph.D. degree in Information and Communication Engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 2025. 
From 2023 to 2024, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. 
Since 2018, I have been a co-founder of Xi'an Lianfeng Acoustic Technologies Co., Ltd., China. 
I am currently a lecturer at the Center for Image and Information Processing, School of Communications and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi'an, China. 
My research interests are focused on deep learning and audio signal processing.
